/**
 * Meta-evaluator for 3-attempt analysis
 *
 * Evaluates all 3 attempts together to calculate:
 * - Final score (considers all attempts with failure penalties)
 * - Consistency score (variance across successful attempts)
 * - Error rate impact (penalty for failures)
 * - Success rate (X/3 format)
 * - Best attempt identification
 * - Reasoning (provided even for 0/3 success)
 *
 * **Key Principle:** 2/3 success ≠ average of 2 scores. Failures are penalized.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * import { MetaEvaluator } from './meta-evaluator.js';
 *
 * const evaluator = new MetaEvaluator();
 * const result = await evaluator.evaluate(
 *   [attempt1, attempt2, attempt3],
 *   'diff --git...',
 *   'complex-feature'
 * );
 *
 * console.log(result.finalScore); // 7.5 (not just avg of successes)
 * console.log(result.successRate); // '2/3'
 * console.log(result.errorRateImpact); // -1.0
 * ```

You are evaluating 3 attempts by the same agent on the same fixture. Your job is to:

1. **Calculate Final Score (0-10):**
   - Consider ALL 3 attempts (successes AND failures)
   - Penalize failures: 2/3 success ≠ average of 2 scores
   - Examples:
     - 3/3 success with scores 8, 8.5, 9 → finalScore ≈ 8.5-9.0
     - 2/3 success with scores 8, 9 → finalScore ≈ 7.0-7.5 (penalized)
     - 1/3 success with score 8 → finalScore ≈ 4.0-5.0 (heavily penalized)
     - 0/3 success → finalScore = 0

2. **Calculate Consistency Score (0-10):**
   - How consistent are the successful attempts?
   - 0 if fewer than 2 successes (cannot assess consistency)
   - 10 if all successes have identical or near-identical scores
   - Lower if scores vary significantly

3. **Calculate Error Rate Impact (≤0):**
   - Negative penalty for failures
   - 0 if 3/3 success
   - -0.5 to -1.0 for 1 failure
   - -2.0 to -3.0 for 2 failures
   - -10.0 for 3 failures

4. **Determine Success Rate:**
   - Count successes and format as "X/3"
   - Must be one of: "0/3", "1/3", "2/3", "3/3"

5. **Identify Best Attempt:**
   - Attempt number (1, 2, or 3) with highest score
   - undefined if all failed

6. **Provide Reasoning:**
   - Explain final score calculation
   - Discuss consistency patterns
   - Explain failure impact
   - **REQUIRED even for 0/3 success** - explain why all failed

Return structured evaluation following the schema.`;

Evaluate these 3 attempts holistically. Consider:

- For successes: How consistent are the scores?
- For failures: What types and how severe?
- Overall reliability: Would you trust this agent?

Calculate final score with failure penalties, assess consistency, and provide detailed reasoning.`;
